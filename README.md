# [Deprecated] Gmail-Unread-Badge
The new Gmail redesign that's being rolled out breaks the way this extension listened for new emails. I'm no longer using it so I won't be continuing with its development.

A Chrome extension that used to add a badge to the Gmail favicon showing the number of unread emails in your inbox.
